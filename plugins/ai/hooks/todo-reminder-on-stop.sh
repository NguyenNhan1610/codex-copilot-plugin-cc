reminder="Before stopping, reconcile your work against \`.claude/project/todos/\`.

Your last turn modified ${total} tracked source file(s):
${file_list}

Action required:
1. Run \`/ai:todo update\` to record progress on ONLY the tasks these edits advanced.
2. Do NOT mark a task you did not actually work on.
3. Do NOT mark a task complete unless its scope is fully covered AND its tests pass.
4. If none of these files map to any existing task, say so in one line and stop — do not invent work.
5. If the TODO already reflects reality, say so in one line and stop — do not touch files needlessly.

When you have finished reconciling (or confirmed no updates are needed), stop normally."
