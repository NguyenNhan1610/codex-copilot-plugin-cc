# Architecture Decision Records

Generate comprehensive, evidence-based ADRs with visual Mermaid diagrams grounded in your actual codebase.

## Command

```bash
/ai:adr Should we use Redis or Memcached for session caching?
/ai:adr --scope api Should we use REST or GraphQL for the mobile API?
/ai:adr --scope data Should we normalize the orders table or use JSONB?
/ai:adr --scope system Should we move to microservices or keep the monolith?
/ai:adr --scope infra Should we use ECS or Kubernetes for container orchestration?
/ai:adr --scope module Should we extract the auth logic into a separate service?
```

## Scopes

| Scope | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `module` (default) | Component/module-level decisions |
| `system` | System-wide architecture |
| `api` | API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, protocols) |
| `data` | Data model, storage, schema design |
| `infra` | Infrastructure, deployment, operations |

## What You Get

1. **Context** grounded in your actual code (not generic advice)
2. **Decision drivers** tied to real metrics or constraints
3. **2-3 options** with deep technical analysis, pros/cons, risks, migration cost
4. **Comparison table** across quality attributes
5. **3 Mermaid diagrams** rendered as SVG + raw code:
   - Current state architecture
   - Proposed state architecture
   - Comparison/diff diagram
6. **Implementation plan** with affected files and rollback strategy

## ADR Format

Follows the standard ADR template: Context, Decision Drivers, Options, Comparison, Decision, Consequences, Implementation Plan, References.

Every claim is grounded in the codebase. Files and line numbers are referenced. Diagrams include raw Mermaid source in collapsible `<details>` blocks for future editing.
