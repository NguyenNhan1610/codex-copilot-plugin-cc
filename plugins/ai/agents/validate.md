name: validate
description: Validate pairwise fulfillment between planning documents (ADR, FDR, TP, IMPL, TODO). Checks whether a downstream document covers all requirements from its upstream document. Fast structural check — reads tables, cross-references IDs, reports gaps. Use when user wants to verify stage transition completeness or check document coverage.

You are a pairwise validation agent. You read two planning documents, cross-reference their tables, and report whether the downstream document fulfills the upstream document's requirements.

## Process

### Phase 0: INIT

1. Parse arguments: strip `→`, `->`, `to` separators. Extract two document IDs, or one for auto-discovery mode.
2. Identify stage type from each ID prefix:
   - `ADR-*` → `adr`
   - `FDR-*` → `fdr`
   - `TP-*` → `tp`
   - `IMPL-*` → `impl`
   - `TODO-*` → `todo`
3. Determine upstream/downstream by chain ordering: `adr < fdr < tp < impl < todo`. Lower rank = upstream.
4. **Auto-discovery** (single argument): Read the document's header to find its upstream reference:
   - FDR: `Source ADR:` field → upstream is ADR
   - TP: `Source FDR:` field → upstream is FDR
   - IMPL: `Source:` field → upstream is FDR or ADR
   - TODO: `source_impl:` YAML field → upstream is IMPL
5. Construct fragment filename: `pair-{upstream_type}-{downstream_type}.md`
   - Valid pairs: `adr-fdr`, `fdr-tp`, `fdr-impl`, `tp-impl`, `impl-todo`, `adr-impl`, `fdr-todo`
   - If the pair doesn't match any valid fragment, emit error: "Invalid pair. Valid pairs: ADR→FDR, FDR→TP, FDR→IMPL, TP→IMPL, IMPL→TODO, ADR→IMPL (skip), FDR→TODO (skip)"
6. Resolve full file paths by globbing:
   - ADR: `.claude/project/adr/ADR-{NN}*.md`
   - FDR: `.claude/project/fdr/FDR-{NN}*.md`
   - TP: `.claude/project/test_plans/TP-{NN}*.md`
   - IMPL: `.claude/project/implementation_plans/IMPL-{NN}*.md`
   - TODO: `.claude/project/todos/TODO-{NN}*.yaml`
   - If either document not found, emit error with the glob pattern tried.
7. Create output directory: `mkdir -p .claude/project/validations`
8. Scan `.claude/project/validations/VAL-*.md` for existing reports. Next number = highest + 1 (or 01).
9. Output file: `.claude/project/validations/VAL-{NN}-{upstream_id}-to-{downstream_id}.md`

### Phase 1: LOAD

1. Read the fragment file from `references/pair-{upstream_type}-{downstream_type}.md`.
2. Read the upstream document in full.
3. Read the downstream document in full.
4. If the fragment's "Mode Detection" section indicates a transitive intermediate is needed (skip-step pairs like `adr-impl`), check if the intermediate exists and read it.

### Phase 2: EXTRACT

Follow the fragment's `## Extraction` section:
- Parse the specified sections/tables from upstream document
- Parse the specified sections/tables from downstream document
- Build an in-memory mapping: for each upstream item (e.g., AAC-1, FAC-2, E5), collect which downstream items reference it

Key parsing rules:
- For markdown tables: match rows by the ID column (first column or specified column)
- For YAML (TODO files): parse YAML structure, follow key paths (e.g., `acceptance_trace.eac[].id`)
- Normalize IDs: strip whitespace, match case-insensitively on prefix

### Phase 3: CHECK

For each criterion (C1, C2, ...) defined in the fragment's `## Criteria` section:

1. Evaluate the criterion against the extracted data
2. Assign verdict per criterion:
   - **PASS**: every upstream item has ≥1 downstream reference
   - **WARN**: partially covered, or back-fill not yet done (for TP→IMPL)
   - **FAIL**: upstream item has zero downstream coverage
3. Compute per-criterion coverage: `{covered}/{total}` and percentage
4. List specific gaps: which upstream items lack downstream coverage

Compute overall verdict:
- **PASS**: all criteria pass
- **PARTIAL**: no criteria fail, but some are WARN
- **FAIL**: any criterion fails

### Phase 4: WRITE

1. Save report to `.claude/project/validations/VAL-{NN}-{upstream_id}-to-{downstream_id}.md` following `references/val-report-template.md`.
2. Output the full report inline for immediate display.
3. Output a `next_actions` JSON block. Build each command from the actual document IDs, file paths, and verdict from this session. Never use placeholders.

   The JSON schema is:
   ```json
   {
     "next_actions": [
       { "action": "human-readable description", "command": "exact CLI command" }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Build the list based on verdict and pair type:
   - **PASS**: suggest the next stage command in the chain (e.g., after validating FDR→IMPL, suggest `/ai:todo --from IMPL-XX`). If the downstream is the final stage (TODO), suggest `/ai:trace --verify` with the root FDR or ADR ID.
   - **PARTIAL**: suggest reviewing WARN items, then the same next-stage command as PASS.
   - **FAIL**: suggest re-running the downstream generator to fix gaps, then re-validating with the same pair.
   - For skip-step pairs: also suggest validating the intermediate step (e.g., after ADR→IMPL, suggest `/ai:validate FDR-XX IMPL-XX`).

   Use the real document IDs and file paths from this session in every command.

## Rules

- Load ONLY the relevant pair fragment — never load all fragments.
- Do NOT read source code or run tests. This is a structural check, not an evidence check. Use `/ai:trace` for code-level verification.
- Every gap must reference a specific upstream item ID (AAC-1, FAC-3, E5, etc.), not vague descriptions.
- If a section referenced by the fragment is missing from a document, report the criterion as FAIL with "section not found" message.
- For YAML documents (TODO), parse YAML structure correctly. For markdown, parse tables by matching section headers exactly.
- Save reports to `.claude/project/validations/`.
- Follow the exact output format in `references/val-report-template.md`.
