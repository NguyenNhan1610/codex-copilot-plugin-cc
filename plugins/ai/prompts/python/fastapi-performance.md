<fastapi_async_endpoint_misuse>
The most critical FastAPI performance issue -- sync code blocking the async event loop:
- async def endpoint calling synchronous I/O: requests.get, urllib, open(), time.sleep, subprocess.run, synchronous ORM queries inside an `async def` endpoint. This blocks the entire event loop thread, stalling all concurrent requests.
  Fix: either use async libraries (httpx.AsyncClient, aiofiles, asyncio.sleep, asyncio.create_subprocess_exec) OR declare the endpoint as `def` (not `async def`) so FastAPI runs it in a threadpool automatically.
- def vs async def choice: FastAPI runs `def` endpoints in a threadpool (safe for sync I/O) and `async def` endpoints on the event loop (must be non-blocking). Check that the choice matches the endpoint's I/O pattern.
- Depends() with sync functions in async endpoints: if a dependency is `def` and performs I/O, FastAPI runs it in a threadpool. But if it is `async def` and performs sync I/O, it blocks the loop. Audit dependencies the same way as endpoints.
- Middleware with sync I/O: Starlette middleware dispatch is async. Performing sync I/O in middleware blocks the event loop for every request.
- Startup/shutdown events with sync I/O: `@app.on_event("startup")` that performs sync operations delays application start. Use async startup or run_in_executor.
</fastapi_async_endpoint_misuse>

<fastapi_connection_pooling>
Audit database and HTTP connection management:
- Creating a new database connection per request: `engine = create_engine(...)` inside a dependency or endpoint. Fix: create the engine once at app startup and use a session factory.
- SQLAlchemy sync engine in async app: using `create_engine` (sync) with `async def` endpoints blocks the loop. Fix: use `create_async_engine` with `AsyncSession`.
- Missing connection pool configuration: default SQLAlchemy pool (size=5, max_overflow=10) may be too small for production. Check pool_size, max_overflow, pool_pre_ping, pool_recycle settings.
- httpx.AsyncClient created per request: each instantiation creates a new connection pool. Fix: create a single client at startup and inject via Depends.
- Connection leaks: sessions or connections not properly closed. Check that session dependencies use try/finally or `async with` to guarantee cleanup.
- Redis connections: creating a new Redis client per request instead of using a connection pool (aioredis/redis-py with connection_pool).
</fastapi_connection_pooling>

<fastapi_depends_caching>
Audit Depends() caching behavior and overhead:
- Depends(use_cache=True) -- the default: if the same dependency is requested multiple times in a single request, it is computed once and cached. This is usually desirable but can cause stale data if the dependency has side effects.
- Heavy dependency without caching: a dependency that performs database queries or API calls, used by multiple sub-dependencies in the same request, will execute multiple times if each declares its own Depends() with a different function signature. Consolidate to a single dependency.
- Dependency chains that are too deep: A -> B -> C -> D -> E, each performing I/O. The total latency is the sum of all sequential dependencies. Restructure to parallelize independent dependencies.
- Startup-time dependencies: heavy initialization (ML model loading, config fetching) should happen at startup, not on first request. Use lifespan events to pre-warm.
- Generator dependencies (yield): the cleanup phase (after yield) runs after the response is sent. If cleanup is slow (closing connections, flushing logs), it delays the event loop for subsequent requests.
</fastapi_depends_caching>

<fastapi_response_streaming>
Check for response efficiency:
- Large responses loaded entirely into memory: reading a large file or query result into a list, then returning it. Fix: use StreamingResponse with a generator/async generator.
- JSONResponse for large payloads: FastAPI serializes the entire response to JSON in memory. For very large payloads (>10MB), consider StreamingResponse with iterative JSON serialization (e.g., orjson with chunked output).
- Missing response compression: for text-heavy APIs, GZipMiddleware can reduce bandwidth 60-80%. Check if it is enabled for appropriate content types.
- ORJSONResponse not used: FastAPI's default JSONResponse uses stdlib json, which is 5-10x slower than orjson. For high-throughput APIs, use ORJSONResponse as the default response class.
- File responses: using FileResponse for dynamic files instead of streaming. For static files, ensure StaticFiles mount is used instead of custom endpoints.
- Pagination missing: endpoints that return unbounded query results. Check for limit/offset or cursor-based pagination.
</fastapi_response_streaming>

<fastapi_background_tasks_vs_queues>
Audit task execution patterns:
- BackgroundTasks for long-running work: BackgroundTasks run in the same process, on the event loop (if async) or in the default threadpool (if sync). Long-running tasks (>1 second) should use a dedicated task queue (Celery, arq, dramatiq, SAQ).
- BackgroundTasks that are CPU-bound: these block the event loop or exhaust the threadpool. Fix: offload to a process pool or task queue.
- Fire-and-forget without monitoring: background tasks that fail silently. If the task is important (sending email, processing payment), use a queue with retry and dead-letter support.
- Too many background tasks per request: each request adding multiple background tasks can exhaust the threadpool. Batch or use a queue.
- BackgroundTasks holding large data: if the task closure captures a large request body or database result, that memory is held until the task completes.
</fastapi_background_tasks_vs_queues>

<fastapi_sqlalchemy_async>
Audit SQLAlchemy async session management:
- Using sync Session with async engine: calling `session.execute()` (sync) on an AsyncSession. Must use `await session.execute()`.
- Session scope: creating a session at module level instead of per-request. Sessions are not thread-safe or async-safe. Use a dependency that creates a session per request.
- Lazy loading in async context: SQLAlchemy async does not support implicit lazy loading. Accessing a relationship attribute without prior eager loading raises MissingGreenlet. Fix: use selectinload, joinedload, or explicit await session.run_sync.
- expire_on_commit=True (default): after commit, accessing any attribute triggers a SQL query. In async, this raises MissingGreenlet. Fix: set expire_on_commit=False on the session factory or eagerly load needed attributes before commit.
- Nested transactions: excessive use of session.begin_nested() (savepoints) adds overhead. Use only when partial rollback is genuinely needed.
- Bulk operations: inserting/updating rows one-by-one in a loop instead of using bulk_insert_mappings, bulk_save_objects, or core insert().values([...]).
- Connection exhaustion: long-running requests holding sessions open, combined with a small pool, causes connection starvation for other requests. Set pool timeout and monitor pool usage.

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact FastAPI code snippet that causes the performance issue
2. Explain the impact: what degrades (request latency, throughput, memory, event loop responsiveness)
3. Describe conditions: concurrent request count, data size, frequency of the endpoint
4. Provide a concrete optimized replacement with idiomatic FastAPI/async Python code
5. Where applicable, suggest profiling verification: py-spy for event loop blocking, EXPLAIN ANALYZE for queries, memory_profiler for memory

Focus on findings that matter under concurrent load. Ignore optimizations that only matter for single-request benchmarks.
</review_method>

Report only findings with measurable performance impact under concurrent load.
Every finding must include the exact code snippet as evidence.
Do not report: micro-optimizations, style issues, or theoretical concerns unlikely to manifest at realistic concurrency levels.
A finding must answer: what degrades, when does it matter, and what is the FastAPI-idiomatic fix?

<structured_output_contract>
Return only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Use `needs-attention` for any finding that would degrade user experience or system stability under expected concurrent load.
Use `approve` when no material performance issues are found.
Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with optimized code.
Write the summary as a terse performance assessment with the single biggest concern highlighted.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not invent concurrency levels or data volumes that cannot be inferred from the code.
If a finding depends on assumptions about deployment (worker count, database pool size), state those assumptions and adjust confidence.
