<python_mutable_defaults>
The single most common Python footgun -- flag every instance:
- Mutable default arguments: `def f(items=[])`, `def f(data={})`, `def f(cache=set())`. The default is shared across all calls, causing silent cross-call contamination.
- Fix: use `None` sentinel and create inside the function body: `def f(items=None): items = items if items is not None else []`.
- Also check class-level mutable attributes that should be instance attributes: `class C: data = []` -- shared across all instances.
- Default argument that is a mutable container from a factory: `def f(config=load_defaults())` -- evaluated once at definition time, not per call.
</python_mutable_defaults>

<python_error_handling>
Audit error handling antipatterns:
- Bare except: `except:` catches SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt, GeneratorExit -- almost never intentional. Fix: `except Exception:` at minimum, prefer specific exceptions.
- Broad except with pass: `except Exception: pass` silently swallows errors, making debugging impossible. At minimum, log the exception.
- Exception as control flow: using try/except for expected conditions (e.g., EAFP overused). When the failure case is frequent, an explicit check is clearer and faster.
- Re-raising without context: `except SomeError: raise DifferentError()` loses the original traceback. Fix: `raise DifferentError() from original`.
- Catching and returning None: functions that catch exceptions and return None, forcing callers to check for None without knowing why. Prefer letting the exception propagate or raising a domain exception.
- Exception classes without __init__: custom exceptions that do not call super().__init__ with a message, producing uninformative tracebacks.
- Nested try/except blocks deeper than 2 levels: restructure with helper functions or context managers.
</python_error_handling>

<python_global_state>
Flag global state mutation patterns:
- Module-level mutable state modified at runtime: `_cache = {}` at module level, mutated by functions. This creates hidden coupling and makes testing require cleanup.
- global / nonlocal keyword usage: `global var` inside functions mutates module state, creating action-at-a-distance bugs. Prefer returning new values or using a class.
- Singleton pattern via module-level instances: `client = HttpClient()` at import time. Fix: lazy initialization or dependency injection.
- os.environ mutation: `os.environ["KEY"] = value` affects the entire process. Prefer passing config explicitly.
- Monkey-patching: `module.function = replacement` in production code (acceptable only in tests with proper cleanup).
</python_global_state>

<python_type_ignore_abuse>
Check for type: ignore as a crutch:
- `# type: ignore` without error code: suppresses ALL type errors on the line. Fix: use specific codes like `# type: ignore[arg-type]`.
- `# type: ignore` used to silence legitimate type errors instead of fixing the code: often indicates a design problem (wrong types, missing overloads, or incorrect annotations).
- Patterns like `cast(Any, x)` or `x: Any` used to bypass type checking -- same category of type safety erosion.
- Excessive type: ignore density: more than 2-3 per file suggests the type annotations are fighting the code's actual behavior.
</python_type_ignore_abuse>

<python_import_antipatterns>
Flag import antipatterns:
- Wildcard imports: `from module import *` pollutes the namespace, breaks IDE tooling, and makes it impossible to trace where names come from. Only acceptable in __init__.py for re-export with __all__ defined.
- Circular imports: often a symptom of tangled module responsibilities. Suggest extracting shared types into a separate module.
- Import inside function body (lazy import) without justification: acceptable for breaking circular imports or deferring heavy dependencies, but should have a comment explaining why.
- Importing private names: `from module import _internal_thing` -- coupling to implementation details.
- Shadowing stdlib modules: naming a module `json.py`, `logging.py`, `email.py` -- causes subtle import failures.
</python_import_antipatterns>

<python_resource_management>
Audit resource management:
- Manual resource management instead of context managers: `f = open(path); data = f.read(); f.close()` -- fails to close on exception. Fix: `with open(path) as f:`.
- Missing context manager for: database connections, HTTP sessions, locks, temporary files/directories, socket connections.
- Custom classes that manage resources without implementing __enter__/__exit__: classes with close() methods that callers must remember to call. Implement the context manager protocol.
- contextlib.suppress overuse: `with suppress(Exception):` is a silent broad catch. Only acceptable for truly ignorable, specific exceptions.
</python_resource_management>

<python_stdlib_reinvention>
Flag reinvented standard library functionality:
- Manual path manipulation with string operations instead of pathlib or os.path.
- Hand-rolled retry logic instead of tenacity or urllib3.util.retry.
- Custom LRU cache instead of functools.lru_cache / functools.cache.
- Manual defaultdict behavior: `if key not in d: d[key] = []; d[key].append(v)` instead of `collections.defaultdict(list)`.
- Manual Counter: `counts = {}; for x in items: counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1` instead of `collections.Counter(items)`.
- Manual groupby/chunking instead of itertools.groupby / itertools.batched (3.12+).
- Custom NamedTuple-like classes instead of typing.NamedTuple or dataclasses.
- Manual OrderedDict behavior (dicts are ordered since 3.7).
- String-based temporary file creation instead of tempfile module.
- Manual enum with string constants instead of enum.Enum.
</python_stdlib_reinvention>

<python_misc_antipatterns>
Additional Python-specific antipatterns:
- isinstance checks against a long chain of types instead of using a Protocol or ABC -- indicates missing polymorphism.
- String-based type checking: `type(x).__name__ == "Foo"` instead of isinstance or Protocol.
- Using assert for runtime validation: assert statements are stripped with -O flag. Use explicit if/raise for input validation.
- Magic method abuse: implementing __getattr__ as a catch-all, making the class interface invisible to tooling.
- Property with side effects: @property that performs I/O, network calls, or expensive computation -- callers expect attribute access to be cheap.
- Overriding __del__ for cleanup: unreliable due to GC timing. Use context managers or weak references.
- Boolean trap: functions with multiple boolean parameters -- `create_user(True, False, True)` is unreadable. Use keyword-only arguments or Enums.

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact Python code snippet that demonstrates the antipattern
2. Name the antipattern and explain why it is problematic in Python specifically
3. Describe the concrete risk: what bugs, confusion, or maintenance burden it causes
4. Provide the idiomatic Python replacement with code
5. Reference the relevant PEP, stdlib documentation, or well-known Python convention

Focus on patterns that cause real problems, not pedantic style enforcement.
</review_method>

<finding_bar>
Report only antipatterns that have concrete negative consequences.
Every finding must include the exact code snippet as evidence.
Do not report: PEP-8 formatting, single-use patterns that do not repeat, or conventions that vary across teams.
A finding must answer: what is the antipattern, why does it matter in Python, and what is the idiomatic fix?
</finding_bar>

<structured_output_contract>
Return only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Use `needs-attention` for antipatterns that will cause bugs or significant maintenance burden.
Use `approve` when the code follows idiomatic Python patterns.
Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with idiomatic replacement code.
Write the summary as a terse pattern quality assessment.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not flag patterns that are idiomatic in the codebase's framework, even if they would be antipatterns elsewhere.
If a finding depends on conventions that vary across teams, lower confidence and note the assumption.
