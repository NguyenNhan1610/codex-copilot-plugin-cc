<django_csrf_protection>
Audit CSRF protection thoroughly:
- @csrf_exempt on state-changing views: this decorator disables CSRF protection entirely. It is only acceptable for webhook endpoints that use their own signature verification (e.g., Stripe webhooks with HMAC). Every other use is a vulnerability.
- Missing CsrfViewMiddleware: check that `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is in MIDDLEWARE. Without it, no views have CSRF protection.
- CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS misconfigured: overly broad origins (e.g., `https://*.example.com` when only `https://app.example.com` is needed). Missing CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for cross-origin POST requests causes silent failures that developers "fix" by disabling CSRF.
- AJAX without CSRF token: JavaScript that POSTs to Django without including the csrftoken cookie or X-CSRFToken header. Check for fetch/axios calls to same-origin endpoints.
- DRF views without CSRF: Django REST Framework SessionAuthentication enforces CSRF, but TokenAuthentication and JWTAuthentication do not. If an API accepts both session and token auth, ensure CSRF is enforced for session-authenticated requests.
- CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True: prevents JavaScript from reading the CSRF cookie, which breaks the double-submit pattern used by many JS frameworks. Check that the template or JS is adapted accordingly.
</django_csrf_protection>

<django_orm_injection>
Audit ORM usage for injection vectors:
- .raw() with string formatting: `Model.objects.raw(f"SELECT ... WHERE id={user_id}")` -- full SQL injection. Fix: `Model.objects.raw("SELECT ... WHERE id=%s", [user_id])`.
- .extra() with user input: `.extra(where=[f"column={value}"])` -- SQL injection. .extra() is deprecated; migrate to .annotate() with database functions or RawSQL with params.
- RawSQL expression without params: `RawSQL(f"UPPER({user_input})")` -- injection. Fix: `RawSQL("UPPER(%s)", [user_input])`.
- QuerySet.filter(**user_dict): if user_dict comes from request data, an attacker can traverse relationships (e.g., `{"author__user__password__startswith": "pbkdf2"}`) to extract sensitive data via boolean-based blind injection. Fix: whitelist allowed filter keys.
- JSONField lookups with user input: `Model.objects.filter(**{f"data__{user_key}": user_value})` allows arbitrary JSON path traversal.
- Aggregation with user-controlled field names: `Model.objects.values(user_input).annotate(...)` -- ORM translates field names to SQL column references.
- Database functions with string interpolation: `Func(Value(user_input), function="CUSTOM_FUNC")` is safe, but `Func(template=f"CUSTOM_FUNC({user_input})")` is not.
</django_orm_injection>

<django_template_escaping>
Audit template rendering for XSS:
- mark_safe with user content: `mark_safe(user_input)` or `mark_safe(f"<div>{user_data}</div>")` -- XSS. mark_safe must only be applied to developer-controlled strings.
- |safe filter in templates: `{{ user_data|safe }}` disables auto-escaping for that variable.
- {% autoescape off %} blocks: disables escaping for the entire block. Check that no user data is rendered inside.
- format_html misuse: `format_html(user_template, **user_args)` -- if the template string itself comes from user input, it is XSS. format_html is safe only when the template is developer-controlled.
- JavaScript in templates: `<script>var data = {{ json_data }};</script>` -- even with auto-escaping, this can break out of the JS context. Fix: use |json_script filter (Django 2.1+).
- Custom template tags that return SafeString with user data: audit all custom tags for proper escaping.
</django_template_escaping>

<django_settings_exposure>
Audit settings for security misconfigurations:
- SECRET_KEY in source code or version control: the key must come from environment variables or a secrets manager. A leaked SECRET_KEY allows session forgery, CSRF token forging, and signed cookie tampering.
- DEBUG=True in production: exposes full tracebacks, SQL queries, settings values, and installed apps to any user who triggers an error.
- ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*']: disables host header validation, enabling host header injection for cache poisoning and password reset link manipulation.
- SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False: session cookie sent over HTTP, vulnerable to network sniffing. Must be True in production.
- SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=False: session cookie accessible to JavaScript, enabling XSS-based session theft.
- CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=False: CSRF cookie sent over HTTP.
- SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False in production: allows HTTP access, enabling MITM attacks.
- X_FRAME_OPTIONS not set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN: clickjacking vulnerability.
- SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=0: no HSTS, allowing SSL-stripping attacks.
- EMAIL_BACKEND set to console or file backend in production settings.
- DATABASE password in settings.py instead of environment variable.
- Logging configuration that logs sensitive data (request bodies, auth headers).
</django_settings_exposure>

<django_admin_security>
Audit Django admin security:
- Admin accessible at /admin/: default URL is well-known. Check for URL obfuscation or IP restriction. At minimum, admin should require 2FA.
- Staff users with is_superuser=True: superusers bypass all permission checks. Audit how superuser status is granted.
- ModelAdmin without readonly_fields for sensitive data: admin users can modify fields they should not (e.g., is_superuser, email of other users).
- Admin actions without confirmation: bulk delete or status-change actions that execute immediately without a confirmation step.
- AdminSite with custom has_permission that is too permissive.
- Admin logging: Django admin logs changes to django_admin_log, but custom admin views may bypass this. Check for unlogged mutations.
</django_admin_security>

<django_session_and_auth>
Audit session and authentication security:
- Session backend: db backend is default and acceptable; cache backend may lose sessions on restart; cookie backend exposes session data to the client (signed but readable).
- SESSION_ENGINE with signed_cookies: session data is client-visible. Do not store sensitive data in sessions when using this backend.
- Login without rate limiting: Django does not rate-limit login attempts by default. Check for django-axes, django-defender, or custom rate limiting.
- Password validation: check AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS is configured with reasonable validators (MinimumLengthValidator, CommonPasswordValidator, NumericPasswordValidator, UserAttributeSimilarityValidator).
- User enumeration: login and password reset that reveal whether an email/username exists. Check error messages and response timing.
- Token-based auth: check that tokens expire, are single-use where appropriate, and use constant-time comparison.
</django_session_and_auth>

<django_file_upload>
Audit file upload handling:
- Uploaded file served without content-type validation: user uploads an HTML file, server serves it with text/html content-type, enabling stored XSS. Fix: serve user uploads from a separate domain or force download with Content-Disposition: attachment.
- FileField/ImageField without validators: missing FileExtensionValidator, validate_image_file_extension. An attacker uploads a .html or .svg file via an ImageField.
- Upload path with user-controlled filename: `upload_to=user_input` or using the original filename without sanitization. Path traversal via filenames like `../../etc/passwd`.
- MEDIA_ROOT served by Django in production: use a dedicated static file server (nginx) or cloud storage. Django's static file serving is not designed for production security or performance.
- File size not limited: missing DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE or FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE. Allows memory exhaustion via large uploads.
- Uploaded file processed without size check: e.g., PIL.Image.open on an untrusted upload without limiting dimensions (decompression bomb).
