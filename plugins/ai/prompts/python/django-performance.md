<django_n_plus_one>
The most common Django performance issue -- audit every queryset iteration:
- N+1 via ForeignKey access: iterating over a queryset and accessing `obj.related_fk` triggers one query per row. Fix: add `.select_related("related_fk")` to the original queryset. select_related performs a SQL JOIN and works for ForeignKey and OneToOneField.
- N+1 via reverse ForeignKey / ManyToMany: iterating and accessing `obj.related_set.all()` or `obj.m2m_field.all()`. Fix: `.prefetch_related("related_set")`. prefetch_related performs a separate query and joins in Python -- appropriate for *-to-many relationships.
- Nested N+1: `for order in orders: for item in order.items.all(): item.product.name` -- needs both `prefetch_related("items")` and `Prefetch("items", queryset=Item.objects.select_related("product"))`.
- Serializer N+1: Django REST Framework serializers that access related fields without the view queryset including select_related/prefetch_related. The serializer looks correct but the view's get_queryset is missing the optimization.
- Template N+1: `{% for item in order.items.all %}` in templates -- the template triggers queries. Fix: prefetch in the view and pass the prefetched queryset to the template context.
- Prefetch with filtering: `prefetch_related("items")` followed by Python-side filtering `[i for i in obj.items.all() if i.active]` defeats the prefetch by re-querying. Fix: use `Prefetch("items", queryset=Item.objects.filter(active=True))`.
- Signals causing N+1: post_save/pre_save signals that query related objects for every saved instance during bulk operations.
</django_n_plus_one>

<django_queryset_evaluation>
Audit queryset evaluation patterns:
- Queryset evaluated multiple times: `qs = Model.objects.filter(...)` used in `len(qs)` then `list(qs)` -- two database queries. Fix: evaluate once with `list(qs)` and use `len(result)`.
- Count via len(): `len(Model.objects.filter(...))` fetches all rows to Python, then counts. Fix: `.count()` executes `SELECT COUNT(*)`.
- Existence check via count or len: `if Model.objects.filter(...).count() > 0` counts all matches. Fix: `.exists()` returns after finding the first match.
- Slicing after evaluation: `list(qs)[:10]` fetches all rows then slices in Python. Fix: `qs[:10]` adds LIMIT to SQL.
- .all() in boolean context: `if queryset.all():` evaluates the entire queryset. Fix: `if queryset.exists():`.
- Queryset caching misunderstanding: Django querysets cache results after evaluation, but a new queryset (e.g., calling .filter() again) does not share the cache.
- .values() / .values_list() not used when only specific fields are needed: fetching entire model instances when only 2-3 fields are used. Especially impactful with models that have many fields or large text fields.
- .only() / .defer() for partial model loading: use .only("field1", "field2") when you need model instances but not all fields.
</django_queryset_evaluation>

<django_caching>
Audit caching strategy:
- Missing caching on expensive views: views that perform complex queries or aggregations on every request without any cache. Check for `@cache_page`, `@vary_on_headers`, or manual cache.get/set.
- Per-view caching without vary: `@cache_page(60)` without `@vary_on_cookie` or `@vary_on_headers` serves the same cached response to all users, including authenticated users seeing other users' data. This is a correctness and security issue.
- Template fragment caching: `{% cache 300 sidebar %}` without a vary argument -- same cache for all users. Fix: `{% cache 300 sidebar user.id %}`.
- Low-level cache without timeout: `cache.set(key, value)` with no timeout holds data forever. If the underlying data changes, the cache is stale until server restart or manual invalidation.
- Cache stampede: a popular cache key expires, and many concurrent requests all recompute it simultaneously. Fix: use cache.get_or_set with a lock, or stale-while-revalidate pattern.
- Caching queryset objects: caching a queryset (not evaluated) caches nothing useful -- the query re-executes on access. Cache the evaluated result (list or dict).
- Session backend as cache: SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache" -- sessions are lost if the cache is evicted. Use "cached_db" for persistence with cache speed.
- Missing cache backend configuration for production: using LocMemCache (per-process, not shared) instead of Redis/Memcached in a multi-process deployment.
</django_caching>

<django_middleware_ordering>
Audit middleware ordering for performance:
- SecurityMiddleware should be first: it handles HTTPS redirects and security headers before other middleware processes the request.
- GZipMiddleware position: should be before any middleware that reads the response body, and after SecurityMiddleware.
- ConditionalGetMiddleware: adds ETag/Last-Modified support. Should be near the top so it can short-circuit 304 responses before expensive middleware runs.
- Custom middleware with database queries: middleware that runs on every request and performs database queries adds latency to all endpoints, including health checks and static files.
- Middleware that processes the response body: any middleware that reads/transforms the response runs for every request, including streaming responses. Check that it short-circuits for responses that don't need processing.
- Too many middleware layers: each middleware adds function call overhead. For high-throughput APIs, remove middleware that does not apply (e.g., SessionMiddleware for stateless APIs).
</django_middleware_ordering>

<django_database_indexing>
Audit database indexing:
- Missing indexes on filter/order_by columns: check `Meta.indexes` and `db_index=True` on fields used in `.filter()`, `.exclude()`, `.order_by()`, and `.values()`.
- Composite indexes: queries filtering on multiple columns (e.g., `.filter(user=u, created__gte=date)`) benefit from a composite index. Check `Meta.indexes = [models.Index(fields=["user", "created"])]`.
- Index on ForeignKey: Django automatically creates an index on ForeignKey fields, but check for missing indexes on fields used as implicit foreign keys (e.g., GenericForeignKey's content_type + object_id).
- Full-text search: using `.filter(name__icontains=query)` for search -- this performs a full table scan. Fix: use `SearchVector`/`SearchQuery` (PostgreSQL), or a dedicated search backend (Elasticsearch, MeiliSearch).
- Unused indexes: indexes on fields that are only written, never queried. Each index slows down writes. Review with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Migration adding index without `concurrently=True` (PostgreSQL): creates a lock on the table during index creation. For large tables, use `AddIndex` with `opclasses` or raw SQL with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
</django_database_indexing>

<django_bulk_operations>
Audit for missing bulk operations:
- Creating objects in a loop: `for item in items: Model.objects.create(...)` -- one INSERT per iteration. Fix: `Model.objects.bulk_create([Model(...) for item in items])`.
- Updating objects in a loop: `for obj in qs: obj.field = value; obj.save()` -- one UPDATE per iteration. Fix: `qs.update(field=value)` for uniform updates, or `bulk_update(objects, ["field"])` for varied updates.
- Deleting in a loop: `for obj in qs: obj.delete()` -- one DELETE per iteration plus signal overhead. Fix: `qs.delete()` for bulk deletion (note: does not trigger signals).
- get_or_create in a loop: `for item in items: Model.objects.get_or_create(...)` -- up to 2 queries per iteration. Fix: fetch existing objects in bulk, then bulk_create missing ones.
- Signal overhead in bulk: `.save()` triggers pre_save/post_save signals per instance. `bulk_create`/`bulk_update` skip signals by default. If signals are needed, document the trade-off.
- Transaction per iteration: each .save() is an implicit transaction. Wrap loops in `with transaction.atomic():` to batch into a single transaction, or use bulk operations.
- Pagination for large bulk operations: `bulk_create` with 100K objects may cause memory issues. Use `batch_size` parameter: `bulk_create(objects, batch_size=1000)`.
</django_bulk_operations>

<django_query_optimization>
Additional query optimization patterns:
- Subquery instead of Python-side filtering: fetching all objects and filtering in Python instead of using `.filter()`, `Subquery`, or `Exists` in the ORM.
- Aggregation in Python: `sum(obj.amount for obj in qs)` instead of `qs.aggregate(total=Sum("amount"))`. The Python version fetches all rows; the aggregate version computes in the database.
- Distinct without database support: using Python `set()` to deduplicate instead of `.distinct()` in the queryset.
- Multiple queries that could be a single annotated query: separate queries for counts, sums, and existence checks that could be combined with `.annotate()`.
- F() expressions not used: `obj.counter = obj.counter + 1; obj.save()` is a race condition under concurrency. Fix: `Model.objects.filter(pk=obj.pk).update(counter=F("counter") + 1)`.
- Large IN clauses: `.filter(id__in=huge_list)` with thousands of IDs. Fix: batch the IN clause, use a subquery, or a temporary table.
