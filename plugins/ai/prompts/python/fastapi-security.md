<fastapi_depends_injection_safety>
Audit the Depends() dependency injection chain for security gaps:
- Missing auth dependency: endpoints that handle sensitive data or state-changing operations without a Depends() that enforces authentication. Check every @app.post, @app.put, @app.patch, @app.delete route.
- Auth dependency that returns Optional[User] without the endpoint checking for None: the dependency resolves successfully but the user is unauthenticated.
- Depends() with use_cache=True (default): if an auth dependency is called multiple times in a request, caching means a revoked token is not re-checked. For sensitive operations, consider use_cache=False.
- Sub-dependency chains: a dependency that depends on another dependency that has no auth. The outer dependency may assume auth was already checked when it was not.
- Permission bypass via dependency override: `app.dependency_overrides` left populated in production code (acceptable only in tests).
- Depends() on a generator that yields before auth check: if the generator yields a resource before validating permissions, the resource is exposed regardless of auth outcome.
- Missing scopes on OAuth2: endpoints that accept any valid token regardless of scope. Check that Security(oauth2_scheme, scopes=["required_scope"]) is used where needed.
</fastapi_depends_injection_safety>

<fastapi_pydantic_validation>
Audit Pydantic model usage for validation bypass:
- model_config with extra="allow" or extra="ignore": allows attackers to inject unexpected fields (mass assignment). For request bodies, use extra="forbid" unless there is a documented reason.
- Validators that catch exceptions and return defaults: `@field_validator` that silently converts invalid input to a safe default instead of raising ValueError. This can bypass security checks (e.g., converting a malicious string to a default role).
- Optional fields without defaults that become None: if downstream code does not handle None, this can bypass required-field validation.
- Union types in request models: `field: int | str` allows type confusion. Attackers send a string where an int was expected, bypassing numeric range validators.
- model_validate with arbitrary dicts: `Model.model_validate(request.json())` bypasses FastAPI's built-in validation pipeline. Use the Pydantic model as a type annotation on the endpoint parameter instead.
- Nested models without their own validators: outer model is validated but inner model accepts anything.
- ConfigDict(from_attributes=True) on request models: allows ORM model attributes to be read, potentially exposing internal fields if the Pydantic model is too broad.
</fastapi_pydantic_validation>

<fastapi_middleware_and_cors>
Audit middleware configuration for security:
- CORS misconfiguration: `allow_origins=["*"]` combined with `allow_credentials=True` -- browsers will reject this, but misconfiguration indicates the developer's intent to be overly permissive. Check that allow_origins is a specific list when credentials are enabled.
- CORS with allow_origin_regex that is too broad: `allow_origin_regex="https://.*\.example\.com"` also matches `https://evil.example.com.attacker.org` if the regex is not anchored properly.
- Middleware ordering: security middleware (auth, rate limiting) must run before route handlers. In FastAPI/Starlette, middleware runs in reverse addition order (last added = first executed). Check that auth middleware is added after (runs before) any data-processing middleware.
- Missing HTTPS redirect middleware in production: `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware` should be present or handled at the reverse proxy level.
- TrustedHostMiddleware missing: without it, Host header injection is possible, affecting URL generation and redirects.
- Custom middleware that reads request.body() and does not reset the stream: downstream handlers get an empty body, potentially bypassing validation.
- GZip middleware before auth: a decompression bomb can exhaust memory before auth rejects the request.
</fastapi_middleware_and_cors>

<fastapi_response_model_exposure>
Check for information leakage via response models:
- response_model missing on endpoints that return ORM objects: SQLAlchemy/Tortoise models may contain password hashes, internal IDs, soft-delete flags, or audit fields. Without response_model, FastAPI serializes everything.
- response_model that includes sensitive fields: a UserResponse model that includes hashed_password, internal_notes, or is_admin. Use separate response models for different audiences (admin vs user).
- response_model_exclude used to strip fields: fragile -- adding a new sensitive field to the ORM model automatically exposes it. Prefer an explicit allow-list (response_model with only the fields you want).
- Error responses leaking internals: custom exception handlers that include traceback, SQL queries, or internal paths in the response body. Check HTTPException detail strings for information leakage.
- FastAPI's default 422 validation error: exposes field names and types from request models. For auth endpoints, this can reveal expected parameter names to attackers.
</fastapi_response_model_exposure>

<fastapi_oauth2_and_auth>
Audit OAuth2 and authentication patterns:
- OAuth2PasswordBearer without token validation: the dependency only extracts the token from the header; it does not validate it. Check that the dependency chain includes actual JWT verification (signature, expiry, audience, issuer).
- JWT decode without algorithm pinning: `jwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=["HS256", "RS256"])` -- an attacker may exploit algorithm confusion (HS256 with the RS256 public key as secret). Pin to a single expected algorithm.
- Token stored in localStorage (if SSR/hybrid): vulnerable to XSS. Prefer httpOnly cookies for web clients.
- Missing token revocation check: JWT-only auth without a revocation list or short expiry + refresh token pattern means compromised tokens are valid until expiry.
- Refresh token rotation: check that refresh tokens are single-use and that reuse triggers revocation of the entire token family.
- Security scopes not enforced: `SecurityScopes` parameter not checked in the dependency, so any authenticated user can access any endpoint.
- API key auth: keys compared with `==` instead of `hmac.compare_digest` -- timing attack on key validation.
</fastapi_oauth2_and_auth>

<fastapi_background_tasks_and_secrets>
Audit background tasks for security:
- BackgroundTasks receiving sensitive data: background tasks run after the response is sent and may outlive request-scoped cleanup. If a background task holds a reference to a decrypted secret or temporary credential, it persists in memory longer than expected.
- Background tasks without error handling: if a background task fails silently, security-critical operations (audit logging, token revocation, notification) may not execute.
- Background tasks accessing request state: the Request object may be partially cleaned up by the time the background task runs. Accessing request.state or auth context may yield stale data.
- Secrets in Celery/RQ task arguments: task arguments are serialized (often as JSON/pickle) and stored in the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ). Passing raw secrets as task arguments exposes them in the broker's storage. Fix: pass a reference (secret ID) and let the worker fetch the secret.
- Background task retry with sensitive operations: idempotency matters -- a retried task that sends an email or charges a card should not double-execute.

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact FastAPI code snippet (route definition, dependency, middleware config)
2. Describe the attack vector specific to FastAPI's request lifecycle
3. Assess impact: unauthorized access, data leakage, privilege escalation, DoS
4. Provide a concrete fix with idiomatic FastAPI code (Depends chains, Pydantic models, middleware config)
5. Trace the request flow from endpoint to vulnerability

Do not report theoretical concerns without a plausible attack path grounded in the code under review.
</review_method>

<finding_bar>
Report only findings with real security impact and a defensible exploit path.
Every finding must include the exact code snippet as evidence.
Do not report: missing docstrings, style issues, or speculative concerns without code evidence.
Prefer one critical finding with full request-flow analysis over five shallow mentions.
</finding_bar>

<structured_output_contract>
Return only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Use `needs-attention` for any finding with a plausible exploit path.
Use `approve` only when no FastAPI security issues can be defended from the code.
Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with fix code.
Write the summary as a terse security assessment, not a neutral recap.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not invent attack scenarios that cannot be supported from the code under review.
If a finding depends on assumptions about the deployment environment or FastAPI version, state those assumptions explicitly and lower confidence accordingly.
