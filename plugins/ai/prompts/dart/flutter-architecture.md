<flutter_architecture_patterns>
Apply these Flutter-specific architectural patterns with expert-level depth:

BLoC pattern:
- BLoC classes that mix UI concerns with business logic (accessing `BuildContext`, navigation, showing dialogs)
- Events not modeled as sealed classes, preventing exhaustive handling in `mapEventToState` / `on<Event>`:
  ```dart
  // WEAK: string-based or unsealed events
  abstract class AuthEvent {}
  class LoginEvent extends AuthEvent { ... }
  // STRONG: sealed for exhaustive switch
  sealed class AuthEvent {}
  final class LoginRequested extends AuthEvent { ... }
  final class LogoutRequested extends AuthEvent { ... }
  ```
- BLoC state not modeled as union (sealed class) with distinct subtypes for loading/success/error
- `BlocBuilder` without `buildWhen` causing unnecessary rebuilds on irrelevant state changes
- BLoC-to-BLoC communication via direct reference instead of through shared repository/stream
- `emit()` called after `await` without checking `isClosed` (emitting on disposed BLoC)
- Business logic in `BlocListener` callbacks instead of in the BLoC itself

Riverpod patterns:
- `StateNotifier` with mutable state fields instead of immutable state + `copyWith`:
  ```dart
  // ANTIPATTERN: mutable state, listeners miss intermediate changes
  class CartNotifier extends StateNotifier<CartState> {
    void addItem(Item item) {
      state.items.add(item); // mutates in place!
      state = state; // triggers rebuild but breaks equality
    }
  }
  // CORRECT: immutable state transition
  class CartNotifier extends StateNotifier<CartState> {
    void addItem(Item item) {
      state = state.copyWith(items: [...state.items, item]);
    }
  }
  ```
- `ref.watch` used in callbacks or event handlers instead of `ref.read` (creates subscription in wrong lifecycle)
- `ref.read` used in `build()` instead of `ref.watch` (misses state updates)
- `FutureProvider` / `StreamProvider` without proper error/loading state handling in UI
- `autoDispose` not used on providers that should clean up when no longer listened to (memory leak)
- Provider dependency cycles detected via `ProviderContainer` debug assertions
- `StateProvider` used for complex state that should be `StateNotifierProvider` or `NotifierProvider`
- Riverpod 2.0 `Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier` not adopted where appropriate (still using deprecated `StateNotifier`)

Repository pattern:
- Repository classes that depend on framework types (`BuildContext`, `WidgetsBinding`, `Navigator`)
- Repository returning Flutter-specific types (`Widget`, `Color`) instead of domain-neutral models
- Missing repository abstraction: data source (API client, database) used directly in BLoC/ViewModel:
  ```dart
  // COUPLED: BLoC depends on concrete HTTP client
  class UserBloc extends Bloc<UserEvent, UserState> {
    final Dio _dio; // infrastructure dependency
  }
  // DECOUPLED: BLoC depends on abstract repository
  class UserBloc extends Bloc<UserEvent, UserState> {
    final UserRepository _repository; // abstract interface
  }
  ```
- Repository implementations mixing caching, network, and mapping concerns (should be layered: remote data source, local data source, repository)
- Missing offline-first strategy: repository doesn't coordinate between local cache and remote source

Feature-first vs layer-first structure:
- Inconsistent structure: some features organized by layer (`lib/models/`, `lib/screens/`), others by feature (`lib/features/auth/`)
- Feature modules importing internal symbols from other feature modules (cross-feature coupling):
  ```
  // COUPLED: feature reaches into another feature's internals
  import 'package:app/features/cart/data/cart_repository_impl.dart';
  // DECOUPLED: import through the feature's public barrel
  import 'package:app/features/cart/cart.dart';
  ```
- Shared/core code not extracted into `lib/core/` or `lib/shared/` with clear boundaries
- Feature-first structure but with shared state management that creates implicit coupling
- Platform-specific implementations (`android/`, `ios/`, `web/`) not abstracted behind a common interface

Dependency injection (get_it / injectable):
- Manual service locator calls scattered through widgets (`GetIt.I<Service>()`) instead of constructor injection:
  ```dart
  // SERVICE LOCATOR (hard to test, hidden dependencies)
  class UserPage extends StatelessWidget {
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final repo = GetIt.I<UserRepository>(); // hidden dependency
    }
  }
  // CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION (explicit, testable)
  class UserPage extends StatelessWidget {
    final UserRepository repo;
    const UserPage({required this.repo});
  }
  ```
- `get_it` registration order dependencies not documented (runtime crash if accessed before registered)
- Missing `@injectable` / `@singleton` / `@lazySingleton` annotations on services that should be auto-registered
- Test doubles not registerable: `get_it` registrations done in `main()` without reset capability for tests
- Scoped registration (`pushNewScope`) not used for per-session or per-feature service lifetimes

Navigation patterns (GoRouter):
- Navigation logic in widget `build()` methods instead of in BLoC/controller redirect guards:
  ```dart
  // FRAGILE: navigation logic scattered in widgets
  if (authState.isLoggedIn) Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/home');
  // STRUCTURED: centralized in router redirect
  GoRouter(redirect: (context, state) {
    final loggedIn = ref.read(authProvider).isLoggedIn;
    if (!loggedIn && !state.matchedLocation.startsWith('/auth')) return '/auth/login';
    return null;
  })
  ```
- Deep link routes not validating parameters (type safety via typed route parameters in GoRouter)
- Missing `ShellRoute` for persistent navigation scaffolds (recreates scaffold on every route change)
- Route definitions scattered across files instead of centralized route registry
- Pushing named routes with string arguments instead of using typed extras or `$extra`
- Missing route guards for authenticated-only routes (relying on widget-level checks instead of router redirect)

State restoration:
- `RestorationMixin` not implemented on stateful widgets that hold user input (form data lost on process death)
- `RestorableProperty` not used for scroll position, tab selection, or form fields
- Large or sensitive state serialized into restoration data (should only store IDs, not full objects)
- Navigation state not restorable (`GoRouter` `restorationScopeId` not configured)

Platform-specific abstractions:
- `Platform.isAndroid` / `Platform.isIOS` checks scattered through business logic instead of behind an interface:
  ```dart
  // SCATTERED: platform checks everywhere
  if (Platform.isAndroid) { ... } else if (Platform.isIOS) { ... }
  // ABSTRACTED: platform behind interface
  abstract class BiometricService { Future<bool> authenticate(); }
  class AndroidBiometricService implements BiometricService { ... }
  class IOSBiometricService implements BiometricService { ... }
  ```
- `kIsWeb` checks in domain logic instead of at the dependency injection boundary
- `dart:io` imports in packages that should be platform-agnostic (breaks web compilation)
- Missing `foundation.dart` `defaultTargetPlatform` usage for testable platform detection
</flutter_architecture_patterns>

<architecture_domains>
Analyze across these Flutter-specific architecture domains:
- State management: BLoC/Riverpod/Provider pattern correctness, state modeling, rebuild scope
- Layer separation: UI / domain / data layer boundaries, dependency direction
- Feature modularity: feature-first vs layer-first consistency, cross-feature coupling
- Dependency injection: explicit dependencies, testability, lifecycle management
- Navigation: centralized routing, type-safe parameters, redirect guards, deep link handling
- Platform abstraction: interface-based platform code, web/mobile portability
</architecture_domains>

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact Flutter code snippet that demonstrates the architectural issue
2. Identify which principle is violated and why it matters in a Flutter application
3. Explain the concrete consequence: what becomes harder (testing, extending, maintaining, platform porting)
4. Provide a refactored Flutter design with code showing the improved structure
5. Assess blast radius: how much of the widget tree and state management is affected

Focus on structural issues that compound over time, not one-off imperfections.
</review_method>

<finding_bar>
Report only findings where the structural issue has concrete negative consequences.
Every finding must include the exact Flutter code snippet as evidence.
Do not report: style preferences, naming conventions, or theoretical purity concerns without practical impact.
A finding must answer: what principle is violated, what breaks or degrades because of it, and how to restructure.
</finding_bar>

<structured_output_contract>
Return only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Use `needs-attention` for structural issues that will compound if not addressed.
Use `approve` when the architecture is sound for the change's scope.
Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with refactored code.
Write the summary as a terse architectural assessment, not a design philosophy essay.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not prescribe architectural patterns that don't fit the codebase's existing style and scale.
If a finding depends on assumptions about the broader system, state those assumptions and adjust confidence.
