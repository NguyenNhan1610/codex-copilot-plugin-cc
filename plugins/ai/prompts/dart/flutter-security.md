<flutter_security_patterns>
Apply these Flutter-specific security patterns with expert-level depth:

Platform channel message validation:
- `MethodChannel` handlers that cast `call.arguments` directly without type validation:
  ```dart
  // VULNERABLE: crashes or type confusion if native side sends unexpected types
  final token = call.arguments as String;
  // SECURE: validate type and content
  final args = call.arguments;
  if (args is! String || args.isEmpty) return null;
  ```
- `EventChannel` stream handlers accepting unvalidated data from native event sources
- `BasicMessageChannel` with `StandardMessageCodec` accepting arbitrary types without schema enforcement
- Missing error handling in platform channel callbacks (unhandled `PlatformException` propagating to UI)
- `MethodChannel` result types not validated: native side could return wrong type, causing runtime cast failure
- Platform channel names hardcoded as strings without centralized registry (enables impersonation in debug builds)

flutter_secure_storage vs SharedPreferences:
- `SharedPreferences` used for tokens, passwords, session IDs, biometric enrollment state, or any credential:
  ```dart
  // VULNERABLE: stored as plaintext in app sandbox XML/plist
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setString('auth_token', token);
  // SECURE: uses Keychain (iOS) / EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android)
  final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
  await storage.write(key: 'auth_token', value: token);
  ```
- `Hive` boxes without encryption enabled (`Hive.openBox` vs `Hive.openBox` with `encryptionCipher`)
- `sqflite` databases storing sensitive data without SQLCipher encryption
- `path_provider` `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` files containing secrets without file-level encryption
- Secure storage accessed in background isolates (flutter_secure_storage is main-isolate-only on some platforms)

Certificate pinning implementation:
- `HttpClient` with permissive `badCertificateCallback`:
  ```dart
  // VULNERABLE: disables all TLS verification
  httpClient.badCertificateCallback = (cert, host, port) => true;
  // SECURE: pin specific certificate or public key
  httpClient.badCertificateCallback = (cert, host, port) {
    return cert.pem == expectedPem;
  };
  ```
- Missing certificate pinning on `Dio` (use `dio_http2_adapter` with custom `SecurityContext`)
- `http` package with no mechanism for certificate pinning (must use `HttpClient` or `Dio` with interceptors)
- Certificate pins hardcoded without rotation strategy (app breaks when cert rotates)
- Pinning only in production but not staging, enabling staging-environment MitM

Code obfuscation:
- Release builds without `--obfuscate --split-debug-info` flags
- `toString()` overrides on model classes leaking field names in obfuscated builds
- Stack traces in error reporting containing deobfuscated class/method names
- `runtimeType` used in production logic (breaks under obfuscation)
- Dart string literals containing API endpoints or internal structure visible in binary

Root/jailbreak detection:
- No runtime integrity checks using `flutter_jailbreak_detection`, `safe_device`, or equivalent
- Security-sensitive operations (biometric auth, payment) proceeding without device integrity check
- Jailbreak detection result cached once at startup instead of checked before each sensitive operation
- Detection bypass not considered: basic checks like file existence (`/usr/bin/cydia`) are trivially defeated
- Missing Frida/dynamic instrumentation detection for high-security apps

WebView security policies:
- `InAppWebView` or `WebView` loading content without `onPermissionRequest` handler (auto-grants permissions)
- `WebViewController` JavaScript enabled without restricting `JavaScriptChannel` message schema:
  ```dart
  // VULNERABLE: any JS on the page can call this handler
  JavaScriptChannel(
    name: 'PaymentBridge',
    onMessageReceived: (message) {
      processPayment(jsonDecode(message.message)); // untrusted input
    },
  )
  ```
- Missing `NavigationDelegate` allowing navigation to arbitrary domains (open redirect via WebView)
- `WebView` loading `http://` URLs without transport security exception justification
- `evaluateJavascript` called with user-controlled strings enabling JS injection
- Cookies shared between WebView and native HTTP client without SameSite/Secure attributes
- `WebView` file access enabled (`allowFileAccess`) in Android without path restriction

Deep link validation:
- `GoRouter` or `Navigator` route handlers parsing deep link parameters without sanitization:
  ```dart
  // VULNERABLE: path traversal, open redirect
  GoRoute(
    path: '/product/:id',
    builder: (context, state) => ProductPage(id: state.pathParameters['id']!),
  )
  // SECURE: validate format
  GoRoute(
    path: '/product/:id',
    redirect: (context, state) {
      final id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
      if (!RegExp(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$').hasMatch(id)) return '/error';
      return null;
    },
  )
  ```
- `uni_links` or `app_links` stream listeners processing URIs without scheme/host validation
- Deep link tokens (password reset, email verification) not validated server-side before acting on them
- Android intent filters with broad `pathPattern` matching enabling link hijacking by malicious apps
- iOS universal links with `applinks` association file not properly configured (fallback to custom scheme)
- Deep link state restoration replaying navigation actions without re-authentication

Biometric authentication implementation:
- `local_auth` used without `biometricOnly: true` allowing fallback to device PIN (weaker factor)
- Biometric result not tied to a server-side challenge (local-only biometric bypass via Frida)
- Missing `useErrorDialogs: false` with custom error handling (default dialogs may reveal auth state)
- Biometric enrollment state cached in SharedPreferences instead of secure storage
- No re-authentication timeout: biometric auth result cached indefinitely

Clipboard and screenshot exposure:
- Sensitive fields using `TextField` without `enableInteractiveSelection: false` (allows copy to clipboard)
- No `FlutterWindowManager` or equivalent to prevent screenshots on sensitive screens
- `Clipboard.setData` with sensitive values without auto-clearing after timeout
</flutter_security_patterns>

<attack_surface>
Prioritize these Flutter-specific attack surfaces:
- Platform channels as a trust boundary between Dart and native (Android/iOS) code
- Local storage hierarchy: SharedPreferences < Hive < flutter_secure_storage < server-side
- WebView bridge as a cross-origin JavaScript injection vector
- Deep links as externally triggerable entry points into app navigation
- Biometric auth as a bypassable local-only check without server challenge
- Background snapshot / task switcher exposure of sensitive screens
- Build artifacts: unobfuscated strings, debug symbols, source maps in release builds
</attack_surface>

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact Flutter code snippet that is vulnerable
2. Describe the attack vector specific to the Flutter platform (e.g., how a rooted device extracts SharedPreferences, how a malicious app intercepts deep links)
3. Assess impact: what damage results (credential theft, session hijacking, payment fraud, data exfiltration)
4. Provide a concrete Flutter fix with replacement code using recommended packages
5. Note platform differences where relevant (Android vs iOS behavior differences)

Do not report theoretical concerns without a plausible attack path from the code under review.
</review_method>

<finding_bar>
Report only findings with real security impact and a defensible exploit path.
Every finding must include the exact Flutter code snippet as evidence.
Do not report: style issues, naming conventions, missing comments, or speculative concerns without code evidence.
Prefer one critical finding with full analysis over five shallow ones.
</finding_bar>

<structured_output_contract>
Return only valid JSON matching the provided schema.
Use `needs-attention` for any finding with a plausible exploit path.
Use `approve` only when no security issues can be defended from the code.
Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with fix code.
Write the summary as a terse security assessment, not a neutral recap.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not invent attack scenarios that cannot be supported from the code under review.
If a finding depends on assumptions about the deployment environment (rooted device, intercepting proxy, malicious app on same device), state those assumptions explicitly and lower confidence accordingly.
