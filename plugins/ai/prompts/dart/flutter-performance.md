<flutter_performance_patterns>
Apply these Flutter-specific performance patterns with expert-level depth:

Widget rebuild cascades:
- `setState()` at a high-level widget causing entire subtree rebuild when only a leaf needs updating
- State management provider (`ChangeNotifier`, `Riverpod`, `BLoC`) emitting state that rebuilds unrelated consumers:
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: entire consumer rebuilds on any state change
  Consumer<AppState>(builder: (context, state, _) => Text(state.username))
  // EFFICIENT: select only the needed slice
  Selector<AppState, String>(
    selector: (_, state) => state.username,
    builder: (_, username, __) => Text(username),
  )
  ```
- `context.watch<T>()` at widget root when only a nested child needs the value
- `AnimatedBuilder` wrapping a large subtree instead of only the animated portion
- `ValueListenableBuilder` / `StreamBuilder` placed too high in the tree

Const constructors:
- Widget classes with all-final fields missing the `const` constructor (prevents compile-time constant folding):
  ```dart
  // MISSED OPTIMIZATION: rebuilds every time parent rebuilds
  Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(16), child: Icon(Icons.home))
  // OPTIMIZED: skipped by framework if parent rebuilds
  const Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(16), child: Icon(Icons.home))
  ```
- `const` constructor available but not invoked with `const` keyword at call site
- Classes with non-const default parameter values preventing const constructor (e.g., `Color` literals not const)
- `Key` parameters blocking const (use `ValueKey(constValue)` only when needed)

ListView.builder vs ListView:
- `ListView(children: [...])` or `Column` with `SingleChildScrollView` for lists with >20 items:
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: builds all 1000 items upfront, holds all in memory
  ListView(children: items.map((i) => ItemWidget(i)).toList())
  // EFFICIENT: builds only visible items + buffer
  ListView.builder(itemCount: items.length, itemBuilder: (_, i) => ItemWidget(items[i]))
  ```
- `GridView.count` / `GridView.extent` with large child lists instead of `GridView.builder`
- `ListView.builder` without `itemExtent` or `prototypeItem` (forces layout measurement per item)
- Nested `ListView` inside `ListView` without `shrinkWrap: true` and `NeverScrollableScrollPhysics` (unbounded height error or performance cliff)
- Missing `addAutomaticKeepAlives: false` on lists with expensive items that shouldn't be kept alive

RepaintBoundary placement:
- Frequently animating widgets (progress indicators, ripple effects, scroll-driven animations) without `RepaintBoundary` isolation:
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: animation repaints parent and siblings
  Column(children: [StaticHeader(), AnimatedProgress(), StaticFooter()])
  // EFFICIENT: isolate animated portion
  Column(children: [StaticHeader(), RepaintBoundary(child: AnimatedProgress()), StaticFooter()])
  ```
- Too many `RepaintBoundary` layers (each creates a separate render layer, increasing GPU memory)
- `CustomPainter` with `shouldRepaint` returning `true` unconditionally
- `Opacity` widget used for animation instead of `FadeTransition` (Opacity repaints entire subtree)

AnimatedBuilder vs setState for animations:
- `setState()` driving animations instead of `AnimatedBuilder` / `AnimatedWidget`:
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: rebuilds entire State widget every frame
  _controller.addListener(() => setState(() {}));
  // EFFICIENT: rebuilds only the animated portion
  AnimatedBuilder(
    animation: _controller,
    builder: (_, __) => Transform.rotate(angle: _controller.value * 2 * pi, child: icon),
    child: icon, // passed as child, not rebuilt
  )
  ```
- `AnimatedBuilder` not using the `child` parameter for static subtrees (rebuilds child every frame)
- `TweenAnimationBuilder` recreated on every build (creates new animation each time)
- Implicit animations (`AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`) used for 60fps+ continuous animations (implicit animations add overhead vs. explicit `AnimationController`)

Image caching and loading:
- `Image.network` without `cacheWidth`/`cacheHeight` for thumbnails (decodes full resolution into GPU memory):
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: 4000x3000 image decoded fully for a 100x100 thumbnail
  Image.network(url, width: 100, height: 100, fit: BoxFit.cover)
  // EFFICIENT: decode at display size
  Image.network(url, width: 100, height: 100, fit: BoxFit.cover, cacheWidth: 200, cacheHeight: 200)
  ```
- `Image.asset` for large images without `ResolutionAwareImageProvider` handling
- No `CachedNetworkImage` or equivalent for lists with repeated network images
- Missing `precacheImage` for images needed immediately on navigation
- `Image.memory` from `Uint8List` recreated on every build (decodes each time)

Shader warmup and compilation jank:
- Missing `ShaderWarmUp` subclass for custom shaders used on first frame (causes jank on first render)
- Complex `CustomPainter` with gradient/blur shaders not pre-compiled via `PaintingBinding.shaderWarmUp`
- `BackdropFilter` (blur) used on large areas without awareness of the rasterization cost
- `ClipRRect` / `ClipPath` with `Clip.antiAliasWithSaveLayer` (forces offscreen buffer allocation)

DevTools timeline analysis hints:
- Patterns that would show red frames in Flutter DevTools timeline:
  - `build()` methods exceeding 4ms (complex widget trees, heavy computation in build)
  - Layout phase >4ms (deeply nested `LayoutBuilder`, `IntrinsicHeight`/`IntrinsicWidth` usage)
  - Paint phase >4ms (complex `CustomPainter`, large `Path` operations)
- `debugProfileBuildsEnabled` flags suggesting investigation areas

Keys for efficient reconciliation:
- Lists without `Key` on items that are reordered, inserted, or removed (framework destroys and recreates state):
  ```dart
  // INEFFICIENT: deletion at index 0 causes all states to shift
  ListView.builder(itemBuilder: (_, i) => UserTile(users[i]))
  // EFFICIENT: stable identity prevents state shuffling
  ListView.builder(itemBuilder: (_, i) => UserTile(users[i], key: ValueKey(users[i].id)))
  ```
- `GlobalKey` used where `ValueKey` or `ObjectKey` suffices (GlobalKey has O(1) lookup overhead + prevents widget reuse)
- `UniqueKey()` used on items (defeats reconciliation entirely, forces rebuild every time)
- Missing keys on `AnimatedList` / `SliverAnimatedList` items (animations applied to wrong items)

Additional Flutter-specific performance concerns:
- `MediaQuery.of(context)` called in `build()` when only `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context)` is needed (rebuilds on any MediaQuery change vs only size)
- `Theme.of(context)` deep in frequently-rebuilt widgets instead of caching the needed values
- `IntrinsicHeight` / `IntrinsicWidth` widgets triggering speculative layout (O(2^n) worst case with nesting)
- `Expanded` inside `Expanded` creating unnecessary flex passes
- `LayoutBuilder` inside `SliverList` items (forces relayout of each item independently)

<performance_domains>
Analyze across these Flutter-specific performance domains:
- Render pipeline: build/layout/paint phase efficiency, widget rebuild scope
- GPU utilization: layer count, offscreen buffer allocation, shader compilation
- Memory: image decode caching, widget state retention, list virtualization
- Animation: explicit vs implicit, repaint isolation, frame budget compliance
- Scrolling: list builder patterns, item extent, keep-alive, key usage
- Startup: shader warmup, deferred widget loading, image precaching
</performance_domains>

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact Flutter widget code that causes the performance issue
2. Explain the rendering impact: which pipeline phase is affected (build, layout, paint, composite)
3. Describe trigger conditions: list size, animation frequency, screen complexity, navigation pattern
4. Estimate severity against the 16ms frame budget (60fps) or 8ms (120fps) target
5. Provide a concrete optimized Flutter replacement with widget code

Focus on findings that cause dropped frames or memory growth. Ignore micro-optimizations.

Every finding must include: file, line_start, line_end, confidence (0-1), and a concrete recommendation with optimized code.
Write the summary as a terse performance assessment with the single biggest concern highlighted.
</structured_output_contract>

<grounding_rules>
Every finding must reference actual code from the provided context.
Do not invent widget tree sizes or animation frequencies that cannot be inferred from the code.
If a finding depends on assumptions about device capability or list sizes, state those assumptions and adjust confidence.
