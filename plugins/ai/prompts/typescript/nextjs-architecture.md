<nextjs_architecture_patterns>
Detect these Next.js App Router-specific architectural issues with high precision:

1. App directory layout organization:
   - Route segments that should be grouped but aren't (related routes scattered)
   - Deeply nested route segments creating URL paths that don't match user mental model
   - Missing route groups `(groupName)` for organizational separation without URL impact
   - Co-located files placed at wrong level (utils in route segment vs lib/)
   - page.tsx files with excessive logic that should be in separate components
   ```
   // PROBLEM: flat structure, no logical grouping
   app/
     admin-users/page.tsx
     admin-settings/page.tsx
     admin-analytics/page.tsx
     marketing-blog/page.tsx
     marketing-landing/page.tsx

   // FIX: route groups for organization
   app/
     (admin)/
       layout.tsx          // shared admin layout with sidebar
       users/page.tsx
       settings/page.tsx
       analytics/page.tsx
     (marketing)/
       layout.tsx          // different marketing layout
       blog/page.tsx
       landing/page.tsx
   ```

2. Server/client component boundary decisions:
   - 'use client' placed too high in the component tree (entire feature is client-rendered)
   - Server components doing work that could be pushed to build time (generateStaticParams)
   - Client components receiving server data as props when they could use server actions
   - Missing composition pattern: server component as parent passing server data to client child
   - Shared components that should have server and client variants
   ```typescript
   // PROBLEM: 'use client' at page level — entire tree client-rendered
   'use client'
   export default function SettingsPage() {
     const [tab, setTab] = useState('general');
     const settings = useSettings(); // client-side fetch
     return (
       <div>
         <SettingsNav activeTab={tab} onTabChange={setTab} />
         <SettingsForm settings={settings} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   // FIX: server page with client islands
   // app/settings/page.tsx (server component)
   export default async function SettingsPage() {
     const settings = await getSettings(); // server-side, no client JS
     return (
       <div>
         <SettingsNav /> {/* 'use client' — small interactive component */}
         <SettingsForm defaultValues={settings} /> {/* 'use client' — form only */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Layout vs template decisions:
   - Layout used where template is needed (component state persists across navigations unexpectedly)
   - Template used where layout suffices (unnecessary re-mount on every navigation)
   - Layout fetching data that varies per-route (should be in page or template)
   - Missing error.tsx or loading.tsx at appropriate layout boundaries
   ```typescript
   // PROBLEM: layout maintains state across child route changes — search input persists
   // app/dashboard/layout.tsx
   'use client'
   export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
     const [search, setSearch] = useState(''); // persists when switching /dashboard/a to /dashboard/b
     return <div><SearchBar value={search} onChange={setSearch} />{children}</div>;
   }
   // Consider: is persistence desired? If not, use template.tsx to remount on navigation
   ```

4. Parallel routes:
   - Independent page sections loaded sequentially when parallel routes would allow independent loading
   - Missing @slot directories for independently-loading sections
   - Complex conditional rendering in page that should be parallel route with default.tsx
   - Dashboard-style pages without parallel routes for each panel
   ```typescript
   // PROBLEM: sequential loading in single page component
   export default async function Dashboard() {
     const analytics = await getAnalytics();  // blocks
     const activity = await getActivity();    // waits for analytics
     const alerts = await getAlerts();        // waits for activity
     return (
       <Grid>
         <AnalyticsPanel data={analytics} />
         <ActivityFeed data={activity} />
         <AlertsPanel data={alerts} />
       </Grid>
     );
   }
   // FIX: parallel routes — each loads independently
   // app/dashboard/layout.tsx
   export default function DashboardLayout({
     analytics, activity, alerts, children
   }: { analytics: ReactNode; activity: ReactNode; alerts: ReactNode; children: ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <Grid>
         {analytics}
         {activity}
         {alerts}
         {children}
       </Grid>
     );
   }
   // app/dashboard/@analytics/page.tsx, @activity/page.tsx, @alerts/page.tsx — each fetches independently
   ```

5. Intercepting routes:
   - Modal patterns implemented with client-side state instead of intercepting routes
   - Missing (.) (..) (...) interception conventions for overlay navigation
   - Intercepting routes without proper default.tsx fallback for direct URL access
   - Complex modal state management that parallel + intercepting routes would simplify

6. Route groups for layout isolation:
   - Multiple authentication states (logged-in vs logged-out) sharing a layout
   - Marketing pages and app pages sharing unnecessary layout overhead
   - Missing route groups to isolate different layout requirements
   ```
   // PROBLEM: auth and public pages share same root layout
   app/
     layout.tsx       // has navigation bar — wrong for login/signup
     login/page.tsx   // shows nav bar from layout — wrong
     dashboard/page.tsx

   // FIX: route groups with separate layouts
   app/
     (auth)/
       layout.tsx     // minimal layout for auth pages
       login/page.tsx
       signup/page.tsx
     (app)/
       layout.tsx     // full app layout with nav, sidebar
       dashboard/page.tsx
       settings/page.tsx
   ```

7. Co-located data fetching:
   - Data fetching logic scattered across components instead of co-located with route
   - Shared data fetching utilities that should be server-only (missing `import 'server-only'`)
   - Fetch calls duplicated between layout and page (not leveraging React's automatic deduplication)
   - Missing cache() wrapper for request-scoped data sharing across server components
   ```typescript
   // PROBLEM: same data fetched in layout and page without deduplication awareness
   // app/dashboard/layout.tsx
   export default async function Layout({ children }) {
     const user = await fetch('/api/user').then(r => r.json()); // fetch 1
     return <Nav user={user}>{children}</Nav>;
   }
   // app/dashboard/page.tsx
   export default async function Page() {
     const user = await fetch('/api/user').then(r => r.json()); // fetch 2 — auto-deduped by React
     // But: if using db.user.findUnique() directly, there's NO deduplication
     return <Dashboard user={user} />;
   }
   // FIX: use React cache() for direct DB calls
   import { cache } from 'react';
   export const getUser = cache(async (userId: string) => {
     return db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
   });
   ```

8. Server actions organization:
   - Server actions defined inline in components (hard to test, hard to reuse)
   - Server actions scattered across files without logical grouping
   - Missing separate actions/ directory or co-located action files
   - Server actions that should be API routes (consumed by external clients)
   - Server actions importing client-side code
   ```typescript
   // PROBLEM: inline server action — untestable, not reusable
   export default function CreatePost() {
     async function create(formData: FormData) {
       'use server'
       // 30 lines of validation, DB calls, revalidation...
     }
     return <form action={create}>...</form>;
   }
   // FIX: separate actions file
   // app/posts/actions.ts
   'use server'
   export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
     // validation, DB calls, revalidation — testable, reusable
   }
   // app/posts/page.tsx
   import { createPost } from './actions';
   export default function CreatePost() {
     return <form action={createPost}>...</form>;
   }
   ```

9. Metadata and SEO structure:
   - Missing or incorrect generateMetadata in route segments
   - Static metadata where dynamic metadata is needed (per-page titles)
   - Missing OpenGraph/Twitter metadata on public pages
   - Metadata fetching duplicating data already fetched by page (not using cache())
</nextjs_architecture_patterns>

<architecture_domains>
Analyze across these Next.js-specific architecture domains:
- Route structure: app directory organization, route groups, parallel routes, intercepting routes
- Rendering boundaries: server/client component split, composition patterns
- Data flow: co-located fetching, cache() usage, server action organization
- Layout hierarchy: layout vs template, error/loading boundaries, metadata
- Code organization: feature co-location, shared component strategy, server-only modules
- State management: URL state vs client state, server action mutations, optimistic updates
</architecture_domains>

<review_method>
For each finding:
1. Quote the exact code snippet or file structure that demonstrates the architectural issue
2. Identify which Next.js App Router convention is violated or underutilized
3. Explain the concrete consequence: what becomes harder (performance, maintainability, UX)
4. Provide a refactored design with code and file structure showing the improvement
5. Assess blast radius: how much of the application is affected

Focus on structural decisions that shape the entire application, not one-off imperfections.
