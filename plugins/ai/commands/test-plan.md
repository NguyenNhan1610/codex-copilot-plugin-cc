Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

The test-plan agent produces a structured test plan by:
1. **Extracting** FAC, I/O tables, edge cases, risks, and fixtures from the source FDR
2. **Inheriting** AAC and invariants from the source ADR (if provided)
3. **Deriving** test cases (TC) with concrete data, each tracing to at least one FAC
4. **Building** traceability matrices: FAC→TC, AAC→TC, Edge→TC, Risk→TC
5. **Identifying** coverage gaps by severity
6. **Saving** to `.claude/project/test_plans/TP-{NN}-{slug}.md`

Operating rules:
- Every TC must trace to at least one FAC.
- Test data must be concrete, not placeholder.
- `traces_to_eac` is left empty ("--") — back-filled when IMPL is generated.
- Do NOT write test code. Only produce the plan.
