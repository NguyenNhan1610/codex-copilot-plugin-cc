Route this request to the `ai:todo` subagent.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

The todo agent manages structured task tracking with full traceability.

Subcommands:
- No args or `board` — show current TODO status as Kanban board
- `--from IMPL-XX` — generate TODO file from an IMPL plan
- `update T{NN} --status {status}` — update task status
- `update T{NN} --ticket {ID}` — link external ticket
- `--sync` — auto-detect completed tasks from cascade log

Execution mode:
- Default to foreground.

Operating rules:
- TODO files are YAML at `.claude/project/todos/TODO-{NN}-{slug}.yaml`
- The agent can Read, Write, and Edit TODO files directly.
- Status transitions must be valid: pending→in-progress→complete, pending→cancelled, any→blocked.
- Every status change should include evidence (file:line) when available.
- Traceability to IMPL/FDR/ADR is maintained via references field.
